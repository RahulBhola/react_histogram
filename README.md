# Project Title
This is a project that displays a histogram of word frequency from a given text file.

## Components
- `Histogram.js`: This component displays the histogram using Chart.js and allows the user to submit a text file and export the data as a CSV file.

## Libraries and Plugins Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- axios: A library for making HTTP requests.
- Chart.js: A library for creating charts and graphs.
- file-saver: A library for saving files on the client-side.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. In the project directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## Usage
Once the app is running, you can submit a text file and see the histogram of word frequency. You can also export the data as a CSV file by clicking the "Export Histogram Data as CSV" button. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
